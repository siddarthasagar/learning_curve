### Direct Answer

The most popular formats to export machine learning models for use in Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and ensure interoperability between Python and Java are primarily **ONNX**, **PMML**, and **MLeap**, depending on the model type. Here's a breakdown for clarity:

#### For Deep Learning Models
- **ONNX** is likely the top choice, supported by frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. It allows models trained in Python to be loaded in Java using ONNX Runtime, ensuring efficiency and broad compatibility. An unexpected detail is that ONNX also supports some non-deep learning models via libraries like sklearn-onnx, expanding its utility.

#### For Non-Deep Learning Models (e.g., Scikit-learn)
- **PMML** and **MLeap** are popular. PMML, an XML-based format, is widely used for general machine learning models and can be loaded in Java with libraries like jpmml-evaluator. MLeap is specifically designed for Scikit-learn and Spark models, offering a format for Java deployment. This is particularly useful for traditional machine learning tasks.

#### Framework-Specific Options
- For TensorFlow models, the **SavedModel** format can be used in Java via the TensorFlow Java API. Similarly, PyTorch models can use **TorchScript**, loaded in Java through the Deep Java Library (DJL). These are efficient but tied to their frameworks.

Choose the format based on your model type and needs, as no single format fits all cases perfectly. For more details, check the official documentation: [ONNX Documentation](https://onnx.ai/), [PMML Specification](http://www.dmg.org/pmml-v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html), [MLeap Documentation](https://combust.ml/mleap/).

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Model Export Formats for JVM Interoperability

This section provides a detailed examination of the most popular formats for exporting machine learning models to be loaded by Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and ensure interoperability between Python and Java, as of March 3, 2025. The analysis covers deep learning and non-deep learning models, framework-specific options, and the supporting libraries, drawing from extensive research into community usage, documentation, and GitHub activity.

#### Overview of Model Interchange Needs
Machine learning models are often trained in Python due to its rich ecosystem (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn), but many production environments, especially enterprise applications, rely on Java for backend systems. This necessitates formats that can bridge these languages, ensuring models can be exported from Python and efficiently loaded in JVMs for inference. The key requirements include compatibility, performance, and ease of use, with formats needing to support both deep learning and traditional machine learning models.

#### Popular Formats for Deep Learning Models
For deep learning models, **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** emerges as the most popular format. Developed by a consortium including Microsoft and Facebook, ONNX is an open standard designed for model interoperability across frameworks. It supports models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and more, with a focus on inference. In Python, models can be exported using libraries like `onnx` or framework-specific tools (e.g., `torch.onnx.export` for PyTorch). In Java, ONNX models are loaded via ONNX Runtime, which offers high-performance inference on CPU and GPU, with Java bindings available on Maven Central. For example, a tutorial demonstrates using ONNX models in Java for image classification, highlighting its broad hardware compatibility ([ONNX Runtime Java](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-java.html)).

An interesting extension is that ONNX also supports some non-deep learning models through the `sklearn-onnx` library, which converts Scikit-learn models to ONNX format. However, this is limited to certain algorithms, with 131 out of 194 Scikit-learn models supported as of the latest documentation ([sklearn-onnx Supported Models](https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/supported.html)). This makes ONNX a versatile choice, though primarily for deep learning.

Other framework-specific formats include:
- **TensorFlow SavedModel**: TensorFlow models can be saved in the SavedModel format, which is language- and platform-neutral, using Protocol Buffers. These can be loaded in Java via the TensorFlow Java API, supporting both CPU and GPU execution. This is particularly useful for enterprise applications, as noted in tutorials on deploying TensorFlow models in Java ([TensorFlow Java](https://www.tensorflow.org/jvm/install)).
- **PyTorch TorchScript**: PyTorch models can be exported to TorchScript, a serialized representation that can be loaded in Java via the Deep Java Library (DJL). This requires converting the model to TorchScript first, with examples showing inference in Java environments, though Java bindings are primarily available on Linux ([PyTorch Java Bindings](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/02/pytorch-releases-java-bindings/)).

#### Popular Formats for Non-Deep Learning Models
For non-deep learning models, especially those from Scikit-learn, **PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language)** and **MLeap** are prominent. PMML is an XML-based standard maintained by the Data Mining Group, supporting 17 model types, including decision trees, random forests, and SVMs. It allows models trained in Python (via libraries like `sklearn2pmml`) to be loaded in Java using `jpmml-evaluator`, with extensive support from vendors like SAS and IBM. For instance, a Stack Overflow post details using PMML for a RandomForestClassifier in Java, noting its ease of integration ([PMML in Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43252501/how-to-use-the-pmml-model-in-java)).

**MLeap**, developed by Combust, is another option specifically for Scikit-learn and Spark ML pipelines. It serializes models to a bundle format that can be executed in Java, with micro-second execution times reported for inference. Documentation shows how to export Scikit-learn models and use them in Java, though its community activity (around 1,000 GitHub stars) is less than PMML or ONNX ([MLeap Documentation](https://combust.ml/mleap/)).

#### Framework-Specific Considerations
For models trained in H2O, another option is exporting to **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)** or **MOJO (Model ObJect, Optimized)** formats. H2O supports both Python and Java APIs, and models can be converted to POJO/MOJO for embedding in Java applications, requiring only the `h2o-genmodel.jar` file. This is detailed in H2O's documentation, with examples of scoring in Java environments ([H2O Productionizing](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/productionizing.html)). However, this is specific to H2O and not as general as ONNX or PMML.

#### Comparative Analysis
To organize the findings, here is a table comparing the formats based on support, use case, and community adoption:

| **Format**         | **Primary Use Case**          | **Python Support**                     | **Java Support**                     | **Community Adoption (GitHub Stars)** | **Notes**                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ONNX               | Deep learning, some ML models | TensorFlow, PyTorch, sklearn-onnx     | ONNX Runtime                        | ~10,000                              | Broad hardware support, limited for non-DL models                        |
| PMML               | General ML models             | sklearn2pmml, jpmml-sklearn           | jpmml-evaluator                     | ~100                                 | Older standard, widely supported by vendors, XML-based                   |
| MLeap              | Scikit-learn, Spark ML        | MLeap Python library                  | MLeap Runtime (Java/Scala)          | ~1,000                               | Fast inference, specific to Scikit-learn and Spark, less community activity |
| TensorFlow SavedModel | TensorFlow models          | TensorFlow                            | TensorFlow Java API                 | N/A (framework-specific)              | Efficient for TensorFlow, requires framework dependency                  |
| PyTorch TorchScript| PyTorch models               | PyTorch                               | DJL, Java bindings (Linux)          | N/A (framework-specific)              | Requires TorchScript conversion, Java support limited to Linux            |
| H2O POJO/MOJO     | H2O models                   | H2O Python API                       | h2o-genmodel.jar                    | N/A (platform-specific)               | Specific to H2O, easy embedding in Java, less general                    |

#### Performance and Efficiency Considerations
Efficiency in JVMs is crucial, with ONNX Runtime offering optimizations for inference, and MLeap reporting sub-5ms response times for RESTful APIs. PMML, while older, benefits from mature libraries, though XML parsing can be slower for large models. Framework-specific formats like SavedModel and TorchScript are optimized for their ecosystems but may require additional setup in Java.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
Research suggests ONNX is the most popular for deep learning models due to its broad framework and hardware support, with over 10,000 GitHub stars indicating strong community adoption. For non-deep learning models, PMML and MLeap are likely the top choices, with PMML being more general and MLeap faster for Scikit-learn pipelines. The evidence leans toward choosing ONNX for deep learning and PMML for traditional ML, with MLeap as a niche but efficient option. Controversy exists around the best format, as it depends on model type, performance needs, and ecosystem integration, so users should assess their specific use case.

For a general recommendation, start with ONNX for deep learning and PMML for non-deep learning models, checking documentation for compatibility: [ONNX Documentation](https://onnx.ai/), [PMML Specification](http://www.dmg.org/pmml-v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html), [MLeap Documentation](https://combust.ml/mleap/).

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Databricks MLflow Model Export Formats

This section provides a detailed examination of whether Databricks MLflow supports exporting machine learning models in the formats mentioned—ONNX, PMML, MLeap, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, and H2O POJO/MOJO—as of March 3, 2025. The analysis draws from official documentation, community resources, and GitHub activity, focusing on the capabilities for exporting models to ensure interoperability between Python and Java, particularly for use in JVMs.

#### Overview of Databricks MLflow and Model Export Needs
Databricks MLflow is an enterprise-grade implementation of the open-source MLflow platform, designed for managing the machine learning lifecycle with enhanced security, scalability, and integration with Databricks' ecosystem. Model export is a critical feature for deploying models in production, especially for ensuring interoperability between Python (where models are often trained) and Java (common in enterprise backend systems). The formats in question—ONNX, PMML, MLeap, TensorFlow SavedModel, PyTorch TorchScript, and H2O POJO/MOJO—are popular for their compatibility and efficiency in JVM environments.

#### Supported Formats in Databricks MLflow

##### ONNX
Research suggests Databricks MLflow supports exporting models in ONNX format through the `mlflow.onnx` module. This module provides APIs for logging and loading ONNX models, which are part of MLflow's built-in flavors. The documentation indicates that models can be logged using `mlflow.onnx.log_model`, saving them in ONNX format, which is interoperable with Java via ONNX Runtime. Databricks' managed MLflow explicitly lists ONNX as a supported flavor, ensuring seamless integration for deep learning models ([Databricks Managed MLflow](https://www.databricks.com/product/managed-mlflow)). This is particularly useful for models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, with an unexpected detail being its support for some non-deep learning models via `sklearn-onnx`, expanding its utility beyond deep learning.

##### PMML
The evidence leans toward PMML not being supported natively in Databricks MLflow. Extensive searches through MLflow and Databricks documentation, including specific queries for "mlflow pmml flavor," reveal no built-in flavor for PMML. An issue on GitHub ([Unable to generate artifacts for pmml models](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/4981)) highlights challenges in logging PMML models, suggesting that users would need to create a custom flavor, which adds complexity. This lack of native support is a notable gap, especially given PMML's popularity for non-deep learning models like those from Scikit-learn, with controversy around whether custom flavors should be the norm for such formats.

##### MLeap
It seems likely that Databricks MLflow supports MLeap, but with a caveat: the `mlflow.mleap` module is deprecated since MLflow 2.6.0 and is recommended to be replaced with `mlflow.onnx`. Documentation ([mlflow.mleap](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.mleap.html)) shows that `mlflow.mleap.log_model` allows logging Spark MLLib models in MLeap format, but notes that it cannot be loaded in Python and requires Java API methods for loading, aligning with JVM interoperability needs. However, its deprecated status means it's not recommended for new projects, and it may be removed in future releases, adding uncertainty for long-term use.

##### TensorFlow SavedModel
Databricks MLflow supports exporting TensorFlow models in the SavedModel format, as evidenced by the `mlflow.tensorflow` module. The documentation ([mlflow.tensorflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html)) indicates that models are exported with a "tensorflow (native) format" flavor, which aligns with TensorFlow's SavedModel format, a standard for storing complete TensorFlow programs. This format is language- and platform-neutral, using Protocol Buffers, and can be loaded in Java via the TensorFlow Java API, ensuring efficiency for JVM deployment ([Using the SavedModel format](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)). This is a robust option for TensorFlow users, with no apparent controversy.

##### PyTorch TorchScript
The evidence leans toward Databricks MLflow supporting PyTorch models, including those in TorchScript format. The `mlflow.pytorch` module ([mlflow.pytorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html)) allows logging models with a "torch (native) format" flavor, which can include TorchScript-serialized models. Community resources, such as a Medium post ([MLflow and PyTorch](https://medium.com/pytorch/mlflow-and-pytorch-where-cutting-edge-ai-meets-mlops-1985cf8aa789)), and examples in the MLflow GitHub repository ([mlflow/examples/pytorch/torchscript](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/pytorch/torchscript)), confirm support for TorchScript, a way to serialize and optimize models for deployment in Python-free processes, enhancing JVM compatibility via the Deep Java Library (DJL).

##### H2O POJO/MOJO
For H2O models, Databricks MLflow has built-in support through `mlflow.h2o`, but primarily in H2O's native binary format ([mlflow.h2o](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.h2o.html)). However, an unexpected detail is that exporting in POJO or MOJO formats—popular for Java deployment—requires a third-party library, `h2o-mlflow-flavor`, available on PyPI ([h2o-mlflow-flavor](https://pypi.org/project/h2o-mlflow-flavor/)). This library provides a `log_model` function with options for MOJO or POJO, as noted in H2O release notes ([H2O Release 3.46](https://h2o.ai/blog/2024/h2o-release-3-46---h2o-ai/)), but it's not pre-installed in Databricks, requiring additional setup. This dependency adds complexity, with controversy around whether such third-party integrations should be considered "supported" out of the box.

#### Comparative Analysis
To organize the findings, here is a table comparing the support for each format in Databricks MLflow, including native support, additional requirements, and status:

| **Format**         | **Native Support** | **Additional Requirements**                     | **Status/Notes**                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ONNX               | Yes                | None                                           | Fully supported, interoperable with Java via ONNX Runtime |
| PMML               | No                 | Custom flavor needed                           | Not natively supported, complex to implement          |
| MLeap              | Yes                | None, but deprecated since MLflow 2.6.0        | Supported but not recommended, may be removed         |
| TensorFlow SavedModel | Yes            | None                                           | Native TensorFlow format, Java-compatible via API     |
| PyTorch TorchScript| Yes                | None                                           | Supported, can be serialized for Java via DJL         |
| H2O POJO/MOJO     | No                 | Third-party library (`h2o-mlflow-flavor`)      | Possible with setup, not pre-installed in Databricks  |

#### Performance and Efficiency Considerations
Efficiency in JVMs is crucial, with ONNX Runtime and TensorFlow Java API offering optimizations for inference. MLeap, while deprecated, provides fast inference for Spark models, but its future is uncertain. H2O POJO/MOJO, when set up, offers micro-second execution times, but the additional setup may impact deployment workflows. PMML, lacking native support, might require slower custom solutions, adding to the controversy around its adoption.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
Research suggests Databricks MLflow supports exporting models in ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel, and PyTorch TorchScript formats natively, with MLeap supported but deprecated, and H2O POJO/MOJO possible via a third-party library. PMML is not supported natively, requiring custom development. The evidence leans toward choosing formats based on model type and deployment needs, with controversy around deprecated flavors like MLeap and the reliance on third-party libraries for H2O. For users, start with ONNX for deep learning, TensorFlow SavedModel for TensorFlow models, and PyTorch TorchScript for PyTorch, checking documentation for compatibility: [MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html), [Databricks MLflow](https://www.databricks.com/product/managed-mlflow).

### Key Points
- Research suggests you can convert a Databricks MLflow PyFunc model to ONNX format if the underlying model supports ONNX conversion.
- It seems likely that conversion is straightforward if the model has a framework-specific flavor like PyTorch or TensorFlow, but more complex if only the PyFunc flavor is present.
- The evidence leans toward needing to check the model's flavors and artifacts to determine feasibility, with controversy around handling models without framework-specific flavors.

---

### Direct Answer

Yes, you can convert a Databricks MLflow PyFunc model to ONNX format, but it depends on the specific model. Here's how it works:

**Understanding the Process**  
A PyFunc model in MLflow is a generic Python function that can wrap models from various frameworks, like PyTorch or Scikit-learn. ONNX is a format for machine learning models, mainly used for deep learning, that allows cross-framework compatibility. To convert, you need to access the original model behind the PyFunc wrapper.

**When Conversion Is Possible**  
- If your PyFunc model also has a framework-specific flavor (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), you can load it using that framework and convert it to ONNX using tools like `torch.onnx.export` for PyTorch or similar for TensorFlow. For example, if it's a PyTorch model, you can use PyTorch's ONNX export functionality.
- If the model only has the PyFunc flavor, you can still try to convert it if the underlying model artifact (like a model file) is present and can be converted to ONNX using the right tool, such as `sklearn-onnx` for Scikit-learn models.

**Challenges and Considerations**  
- Conversion might be tricky if the model only has the PyFunc flavor, as you’ll need to inspect the model directory to find and identify the original model. This requires knowing the framework and having the right conversion tool.
- An unexpected detail is that even if the model is from a framework like Scikit-learn, which isn’t deep learning, you can still convert it to ONNX using libraries like `sklearn-onnx`, expanding the possibilities beyond deep learning models.

To check if conversion is possible, look at the model's `MLmodel` file to see what flavors it supports. If it has a convertible framework flavor, you’re good to go. For more details, see the MLflow models documentation ([MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html)).

### Comprehensive Analysis of Converting Databricks MLflow PyFunc Models to ONNX Format

This section provides a detailed examination of whether and how a Databricks MLflow PyFunc model can be converted to ONNX format, as of 11:02 PM PST on Monday, March 3, 2025. The analysis draws from official documentation, community resources, and practical considerations, focusing on the feasibility and process for ensuring interoperability with Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), given ONNX's compatibility with Java via ONNX Runtime.

#### Overview of Databricks MLflow PyFunc Models and ONNX Format
Databricks MLflow is an enterprise-grade implementation of the open-source MLflow platform, designed for managing the machine learning lifecycle with enhanced security and scalability. The PyFunc flavor in MLflow provides a generic Python function interface for models, allowing them to be loaded and used for inference in Python, regardless of the original framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn). ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open format for representing machine learning models, primarily designed for deep learning, enabling cross-framework compatibility and efficient deployment, including in JVMs via ONNX Runtime.

The question is whether a PyFunc model, which may encapsulate various underlying models, can be converted to ONNX format, and if so, how. This involves understanding the structure of PyFunc models, the requirements for ONNX conversion, and the practical steps involved.

#### Feasibility of Conversion
Research suggests that converting a Databricks MLflow PyFunc model to ONNX format is possible, but it depends on the underlying model's framework and how it was saved in MLflow. The evidence leans toward the conversion being straightforward if the model has a framework-specific flavor that supports ONNX conversion, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, but more complex if only the PyFunc flavor is present. There is controversy around handling models without framework-specific flavors, as it requires additional steps to identify and extract the original model.

To determine feasibility, the first step is to check the model's flavors, which are listed in the `MLmodel` file within the model directory. Each MLflow model can have multiple flavors, and the PyFunc flavor is often added alongside framework-specific flavors when using `mlflow.<framework>.log_model`. For example, saving a PyTorch model with `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` logs both the `torch` flavor and the `pyfunc` flavor, allowing the model to be loaded as either.

#### Conversion Process Based on Model Flavors
The conversion process varies depending on the available flavors:

1. **Model Has ONNX Flavor**:  
   If the model already has the ONNX flavor, as indicated by a `[onnx]` section in the `MLmodel` file, it is already in ONNX format. In this case, no conversion is needed, and the model can be loaded and used directly with ONNX Runtime in Java. This scenario is less common for a PyFunc model unless it was explicitly logged as an ONNX model using `mlflow.onnx.log_model`.

2. **Model Has Framework-Specific Flavor Supporting ONNX**:  
   If the model has a flavor from a framework that supports ONNX conversion, such as `torch` (PyTorch), `tf` (TensorFlow), or even `sklearn` (via `sklearn-onnx`), conversion is straightforward. For example:
   - For PyTorch models, you can load the model using `mlflow.pytorch.load_model(model_URI)` to get the PyTorch model object, then use `torch.onnx.export` to convert it to ONNX. An example from the documentation shows training a PyTorch model, converting it to ONNX, and logging it ([MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html)).
   - For TensorFlow models, you can load the model using `mlflow.tensorflow.load_model` and use TensorFlow's ONNX conversion tools, though this may require additional libraries like `tf2onnx`.
   - For Scikit-learn models, while not deep learning, conversion is possible using the `sklearn-onnx` library, which supports 131 out of 194 Scikit-learn models as of the latest documentation ([sklearn-onnx Supported Models](https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/supported.html)). This is an unexpected detail, as ONNX is often associated with deep learning, but it extends to traditional machine learning models.

   In these cases, the process involves:
   - Loading the model using the framework-specific flavor.
   - Using the framework's ONNX export functionality to save the model as an ONNX file.
   - Optionally, logging the ONNX model back to MLflow using `mlflow.onnx.log_model` for tracking.

3. **Model Only Has PyFunc Flavor**:  
   If the model only has the PyFunc flavor, conversion is more complex. The PyFunc model is stored as a directory containing:
   - An `MLmodel` file describing the flavors and metadata.
   - A `model.py` file that implements a Python function for prediction.
   - Additional model artifacts, which could include the original model file (e.g., `.pth` for PyTorch, `.pkl` for Scikit-learn).

   In this case, you need to inspect the model directory to identify the underlying model artifact. For example:
   - If there's a `.pth` file, it’s likely a PyTorch model, which can be loaded with `torch.load` and converted to ONNX.
   - If there's a `.pkl` file and the model.py references Scikit-learn, you can load it with `joblib.load` or `pickle.load` and use `sklearn-onnx` for conversion.

   However, this approach requires knowing the original framework and having the necessary conversion tools, making it less general and more error-prone. For instance, if the model.py wraps a custom Python function without a clear model file, conversion to ONNX may not be possible, as ONNX requires a defined computational graph, which generic Python functions may not provide.

#### Practical Considerations and Challenges
The evidence leans toward the conversion process being framework-dependent, with controversy around models saved only as PyFunc without framework-specific flavors. Key challenges include:
- **Identifying the Original Framework**: If the model only has the PyFunc flavor, you need to parse the `model.py` file or inspect artifacts to determine the framework, which may not always be clear.
- **Dependency on Conversion Tools**: Conversion requires framework-specific libraries (e.g., `torch.onnx`, `sklearn-onnx`), which must be installed and compatible with the model version.
- **Performance and Efficiency**: ONNX is optimized for inference, particularly in JVMs, but the conversion process itself may introduce overhead, especially for non-deep learning models.

An unexpected detail is that even non-deep learning models, like those from Scikit-learn, can be converted to ONNX, expanding the applicability beyond deep learning frameworks. This is particularly useful for ensuring interoperability with Java, as ONNX Runtime has Java bindings available on Maven Central ([ONNX Runtime Java](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-java.html)).

#### Comparative Analysis
To organize the findings, here is a table comparing the conversion feasibility based on model flavors:

| **Scenario**                          | **Conversion Possible?** | **Process**                                                                 | **Notes**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model has ONNX flavor                 | Yes                      | Already in ONNX format, no conversion needed.                               | Load and use with ONNX Runtime for Java deployment.                       |
| Model has torch flavor (PyTorch)      | Yes                      | Load with `mlflow.pytorch.load_model`, use `torch.onnx.export`.             | Straightforward, requires PyTorch and ONNX libraries.                     |
| Model has tf flavor (TensorFlow)      | Yes                      | Load with `mlflow.tensorflow.load_model`, use `tf2onnx` or similar.         | May require additional libraries, check TensorFlow version compatibility. |
| Model has sklearn flavor (Scikit-learn)| Yes                      | Load with `mlflow.sklearn.load_model`, use `sklearn-onnx`.                  | Limited to supported models, check `sklearn-onnx` documentation.          |
| Model only has PyFunc flavor          | Maybe                    | Inspect model directory, identify artifact, use framework-specific converter.| Complex, requires knowing framework and conversion tool, may not be possible. |

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
Research suggests that converting a Databricks MLflow PyFunc model to ONNX format is possible if the model has a framework-specific flavor that supports ONNX conversion, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn (via `sklearn-onnx`). It seems likely that for models only with the PyFunc flavor, conversion is feasible if the underlying model artifact can be identified and converted, but this is more involved and framework-dependent. The evidence leans toward checking the `MLmodel` file first to determine available flavors, with controversy around handling models without framework-specific flavors, as it requires additional inspection and may not always succeed.

For users, start by checking the model's flavors using the `MLmodel` file. If it has a convertible flavor, follow the framework-specific conversion process. If only PyFunc is present, inspect the model directory for artifacts and use the appropriate conversion tool, consulting documentation for details: [MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html), [ONNX Runtime Java](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-java.html), [sklearn-onnx Supported Models](https://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/supported.html).
