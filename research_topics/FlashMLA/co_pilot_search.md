#### **3. Sparse Attention Mechanisms**

- **Concept**: Modify attention layers to focus on important tokens, reducing computation.
- **Benefit**: Handle longer sequences efficiently.
- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from flash_mla.attention import SparseAttention

  for layer in fused_model.encoder.layer:
      layer.attention.self = SparseAttention(layer.attention.self)
  ```
